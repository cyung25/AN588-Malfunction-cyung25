```{r}
## make z prop test with estimated proportion and sample size for first sample, second sample is null. p0 is expected population proportion, alt hypothesis is 2 sided. 
Z.prop.test <- function (p1, n1, p2 = NULL, n2 = NULL, p0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95) {
  ## check normal approximation validity, add warning message
check_validity <- function(p, n) { 
  if (n * p <= 5 || n * (1 - p) <= 5) { 
    warning ("Normal approximation might not valid: n * p and n * (1 - p) should both be > 5.") 
  } 
  }
## One-sample or two-sample scenario
if (is.null(p2) || is.null(n2)) { check_validity(p1, n1) } else { 
  check_validity(p1, n1) 
  check_validity(p2, n2) 
}
}
##Soumalya's Comment: You’ve done a great job setting up the function structure and validity checks! The next step would be to add the Z-test calculations. For example, you could compute the test statistic (Z) and confidence intervals based on p0 (for one-sample) or the pooled proportion (for two-sample). The function is almost there; just needs the final statistical pieces to tie everything together.

## this presents the data but I still need to figure out how to present each of the CIs.

```{r}
##load dataset
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("/Users/charlesyung/Desktop/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
head(data, 10)
str(data)
summary(data)
## create regression model
m1 <- lm(MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean, data = data)
m2 <- lm(log(MaxLongevity_m) ~ log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean), data = data)
summary(m1)
summary(m2)
##Soumalya's Comment: Nice work loading the data and fitting both models! The summaries provide useful insights. If you’d like to go a bit further, you could briefly interpret the slope estimates (e.g., "A 1gm increase in brain size is associated with a month change in longevity"). This would help connect the numbers to the biological context.
ggplot(data, aes(x = Brain_Size_Species_Mean, y = MaxLongevity_m)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "cyan") +
  labs(title = "Longevity vs. Brain Size",
       x = "Brain Size (g)", 
       y = "Longevity (months)") +
  annotate("text", x = 1000, y = 1000, 
           label = paste0("y = ", round(coef(model1)[1], 2), 
                          " + ", round(coef(model1)[2], 2), "x"), 
           color = "purple")
##Soumalya's Comment: The plot looks clean and visually appealing! Two small tweaks could make it even better: 1) Use m1 instead of model1 to match your model object names. 2) Adding se = TRUE to geom_smooth() would show confidence bands, which the assignment requests. The equation annotation is a great touch. It really helps interpret the plot.
## create the log regression model
ggplot(data, aes(x = log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean), y = log(MaxLongevity_m))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Log Longevity vs. Brain Size",
       x = "Log Brain Size", 
       y = "Log Longevity") +
  annotate("text", x = 5, y = 6, 
           label = paste0("log(y) = ", round(coef(model2)[1], 2), 
                          " + ", round(coef(model2)[2], 2), " log(x)"), 
           color = "black")
##Soumalya's Comment: This is a solid log-log plot! Like the previous one, you might consider: 1) Ensuring the model name matches (m2 instead of model2). 2) Adding confidence bands with se = TRUE. The log transformation is well-executed, and the equation annotation is clear.
model <- lm(MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean, data = data)
summary(model)
slope.test <- function(beta1) {
    g <- ggplot(data = z, aes(x = x, y = y))
    g <- g + geom_point()
    g <- g + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = beta1, size = 1, colour = "blue",
        alpha = 1/2)
    ols <- sum((y - beta1 * x)^2)
    g <- g + ggtitle(paste("Slope = ", beta1, "\nSum of Squared Deviations = ",
        round(ols, 3)))
    g
}
beta1 <- cor(y, x) * (sd(y)/sd(x))
beta1 <- cov(y, x)/var(x)
beta1 <- sum((y - mean(y)) * (x - mean(x)))/sum((x - mean(x))^2)
beta1
ci <- predict(m, newdata = data.frame, interval = "confidence",
    level = 0.90) 
ci
## I still haven't figured out the point estimate part yet.
